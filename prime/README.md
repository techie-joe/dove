> **Your design, your content, your way.**

## How to use

To use the theme on your site:

1. Add the following lines to the `_config.yml` file at the root of your site's repository:

    ```yml
    remote_theme: techie-joe/prime
    plugins:
        - jekyll-remote-theme
    ```

2. Clear out any existing values of `theme`.

3. Then, activate **GitHub Pages** for your site.

_For detailed instruction, see [The GitHub Pages Walkthrough](https://techie-joe.github.io/library/github-pages/)._

## How to customize

### Configuration variables

Set the following variables in your site's `_config.yml` file.

```yml
title       : "The title of your site"
description : "Short description of your site."
```

Additionally, you may also set:

```yml
ghost: your-tracking-id
# to track your ThemeJs.

google_analytics: your-tracking-id
# to track your website using Google Analytics.

cloudflare_analytics: your-tracking-id
# to track your website using Cloudflare Analytics.

show_downloads: true
# true or false (unquoted).
# to indicate whether to provide a download URL.
```

### Stylesheet

To add your own custom styles:

1. Create a file called `/assets/css/style.scss` in your site's repository with the following content, exactly as shown:

    ```scss
    ---
    ---
    @import "prime";
    ```

2. Add any custom styles immediately after the `@import` line.

_**Note:** To change the theme's SASS variables, you must set new values before the `@import` line in your stylesheet._

### Layouts

All [theme layouts](https://github.com/techie-joe/prime/tree/master/_layouts) in the `_layouts` folder and [theme components](https://github.com/techie-joe/prime/tree/master/_includes) in the `_includes` folder provide a good starting point of things you can customize. To override a file, create a mirror copy of that file in your site's repository reflecting the exact path and file-name.

For example, to change the default layout:

1. Copy the `/_layouts/default.html` file to your site's repository.
2. Then customize it as you'd like.

_**Pro-tip:** click "raw" to make copying easier._

### Analytics code

Paste the analytics code into your site's `_includes/google_analytics.html` file.

### Overriding GitHub values

The theme rely on GitHub values, such as links to your repository or links to download your project.

To override the default values:

1. Look at the theme source file (in the `_layouts` and `_includes` folder) to determine the name of the variable. It will be in the form of:

    {% raw %}
    ```liquid
    {{ site.github.zip_url }}
    ```
    {% endraw %}

2. Specify the value you'd like to use in your site's `_config.yml` file. Jekyll will use the value you specified, instead of the default one.  

    For example, if the variable was `site.github.zip_url`, add the following:

    ```yml
    github:
        zip_url: http://example.com/download.zip
        # another_url: another_value
    ```

    > _**Note:** Ignore the `site.` prefix, and maintain the two space indent for each sub variables._

_For more information, see [Jekyll documentation on Variables](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/variables/)._

## Running the theme locally

To run the theme locally:

1. Clone the theme's repository into your computer:
    
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/techie-joe/prime
    ```

2. Go to the cloned directory.

3. Add the following code to your site's `Gemfile`:

    ```ruby

    > _This is a required one-time setup before other script can function._
